# Pepcoding-Hackathon-Automation-Project


## My - idea 

Being a junior undergrad I have faced the times in past where it was very difficult to find good resources for DSA and a best institute where I can get good guidance about the path to succeed 

So , I made a Automation Project using JavaScript [ including Node.js ] and an automation library " Puppeteer " which helps to resolve this confusion and gives a one stop platform to trust upon i.e "Pepcoding " . 
For this project , I automated the following 3 sites :

* Youtube 
* Google Maps
* Google 

The automation video is given below for quick reference  :


 
 
## Workflow of the automated code 
Things that will be automated to get the desired result are :
1. The chromium browser will open Youtube and type in search box " Best data structure and algorithm foundation course " .

2. The first video will be the one you need to trust [recommended] by ' Mr. Sumeet Malik "

3. It will clicked and played automatically for few seconds 

4. Then the official youtube channel of pepcoding will be opened automatically to have a basic view and a Screenshot will be taken for future reference.

5. To get the complete details like " Rating " , " Reviews " , " Location " , " Timings" , " Website " , " Telephone No. " the code is automated to open Google Maps and give the required information and a Screenshot will be taken for future reference 

6. From the details acquired , the code will take you to the official website of  " PepCoding " 

7. First it will take you to the Courses Tab to give a general view of what type of courses are available and also takes a screenshot for future reference.

8. Similarly it will also navigate to Placements , Reviews and Teams tab  and also takes screenshots for future reference , to give complete overview of the website and enough things for you to plan your future .

9. With all these steps , the automation process comes to an end and in your hand you have the best place to be a part to make you future ðŸ”¥



Here are screenshots you have after the automation process :
